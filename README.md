# Expo "Add to Cart" Snack app

Our ITELECTIVE 2 assignment is a small-scale project focused on integrating with a Supabase backend. 
We've successfully established connectivity to receive and display products. However, a key area for
future development includes implementing real-time capabilities for immediate data synchronization,
such as detecting and updating user orders instantly. Furthermore, this project is still in its
development phase and has not yet been fully built or optimized as a deployable APK (Android Package Kit).
